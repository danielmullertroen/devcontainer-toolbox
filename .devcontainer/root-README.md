# DevContainer Toolbox

A comprehensive development container setup that provides a consistent development environment across Windows, Mac, and Linux. This toolbox includes configurations and tools for working with Azure infrastructure, data platforms, security operations, development, and monitoring.

## About

The DevContainer Toolbox provides:

- A pre-configured development environment using Debian 12 Bookworm
- Essential base tools including Azure CLI, Python, Node.js, and common command-line utilities
- Core VS Code extensions for Azure development, PowerShell, Markdown, and YAML support
- Extensible architecture allowing easy addition of role-specific tools
- Consistent environment across all development machines

## Problem Solved

- Eliminates "it works on my machine" issues by providing a standardized development environment
- Simplifies onboarding of new developers with a ready-to-use development setup
- Allows safe experimentation with new tools without affecting your local machine
- Provides a modular approach to adding role-specific development tools
- Ensures consistent tooling across team members regardless of their operating system

## What are DevContainers, and why is everyone talking about it?

- [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
- [Youtube: Get Started with Dev Containers in VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1RavPr_878&t=38s)

## How to set it up

1. Download the repository zip file from: <https://github.com/terchris/devcontainer-toolbox/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>
2. In your development repository, copy the following folders:
   - `.devcontainer`
   - `.devcontainer.extend`
   - `.vscode/settings.json` (if you don't already have one)
3. Open your repository in VS Code by running `code .`
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"

Or

1. git clone https://github.com/terchris/devcontainer-toolbox.git
2. Make sure you checkout the repo with LF line endings otherwise the shell scripts will return an error.

Or

### Fetch the download script

Open the directory where you would like to store the devcontainers repository and
execute the following command to fetch the download script. Once downloaded run it
in powershell. The script will download 2 folders into your current working folder,
.devcontainer and .devcontainer.extend.

```powershell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/norwegianredcross/devcontainer-toolbox/refs/heads/main/update-devcontainer.ps1 -O update-devcontainer.ps1
```

Continue with the installation of VSCode. After the installation finishes, navigate
to this folder and open it with VSCode.

## How to extend the devcontainer

Add project dependencies to the script [project-installs.sh](.devcontainer.extend/project-installs.sh) and the next developer will thank you.
See [readme-devcontainer-extend.md](.devcontainer.extend/readme-devcontainer-extend.md)

## Alternate IDEs

This howto uses vscode. But you can use other IDEs.
